### GeoGuessr

Users can try to guess the location of a given picture, using cars, buildings, roads, weather or other characteristics as hints.

Write the following command to start a game and receive a location picture:

```bash
!dv geo start
```

With this command users can make a guess:
```bash
!dv geo guess [location]
```
